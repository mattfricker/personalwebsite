        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>My goal is to become highly skilled in both front-end and back-end development, with the capability of creating database-driven dynamic visualizations.</p>
        <p>I am currently redesigning the Center for the Study of Targeted Killing&apos;s website, using Angularjs, Sass, several components of Bootstrap, and NVD3.</p>
        <p>I still need to complete: 
            1 - In-depth statistical calculations. 
            2 - Allow users to filter multiple coutries at once. 
            3 - Create dynamic visualizations using NVD3. 
            4 - Complete the Methodology and About views. 
            5 - Media Queries for readability.
            6 - Refine styles for the currently available views.
