        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>My goal is to become highly skilled in JavaScript and PHP, capable of creating database-driven dynamic visualizations.</p>
        <p>I am currently working on redesigning the front-end for the Center for the Study of Targeted Killing. This project has pushed me to learn more about the Laravel framework, which was leveraged to create the site. I have yet to get a clone of the live site to work on a Vagrant box running Homestead, but I continue to push forward.</p>
        <p>Right now, I have just completed a transition of this site to use Sass and will now be learning Backbone.js. Long-term, I plan to achieve adcanced proficiency in JavaScript, jQuery, d3.js, PHP, and Laravel.</p>
